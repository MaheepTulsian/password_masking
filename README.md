## Password Masking in C

This repository contains a C code snippet that enables secure password masking in the console. When users enter their passwords, the characters are masked with asterisks, enhancing privacy and security during input. The code utilizes the `<conio.h>` library, making it compatible with Windows platforms.

### Features:

- **Secure Password Input:** Password characters are masked with asterisks (`*`) as the user enters them, preventing direct visibility on the screen.

- **Backspace Support:** Users can use the Backspace key to delete characters during password input if they make a mistake.

- **User-Friendly:** The implementation ensures a smooth and intuitive password entry experience.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository or download the `password_masking.c` file.

2. Compile the code using a C compiler for your platform (e.g., GCC on Windows).

3. Run the executable to execute the password masking program.

4. Enter your password securely without displaying the characters on the screen.

### Platform Compatibility:

The code is designed to work on Windows platforms due to its reliance on the `<conio.h>` library. If you plan to use it on other operating systems, you may need to adapt the code to handle password masking differently.
